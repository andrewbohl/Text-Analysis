# Text-Analysis
The aim of this project was to inform consumers of the best ways to research video games before purchase based on reviews. 
We built web scrapers to collect informal and formal review data from Reditt and MetaCritic.
Through our analysis we noticed that Reddit and forum platforms are best suited for pre-release promotion and Indie games where AAA games can thrive on formal review sites.
In addition, we saw that paid critics generally gave higher scores and talked more positively about the games then common users.
